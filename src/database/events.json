        "description": "On November 29, 2014, eight-year-old Loris Stival was found dead in a canal near Santa Croce Camerina, Sicily. His mother, Veronica Panarello, initially reported him missing but later confessed to strangling him with electrical cables. She claimed he had discovered her affair with his grandfather, Andrea Stival, and threatened to tell his father. Panarello was sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder and concealment of a body. In 2023, she received an additional two-year sentence for defaming her father-in-law during the investigation. "
